                    IUB is a private university in Bangladesh. It is located in Bashundhara Residential Area of Dhaka,
                    Bangladesh. It was established in 1993 under the Private University Act, 1992.[1][2] With an
                    explicit focus on Research and Global partnerships. IUB has an enrollment of 7,378 students, 11,556
                    alumni and 401 faculty members (of which 38% have PhD's mostly from North America). The campus is
                    spread over three acres and is well-equipped with an amphitheatre, a library, state-of-the-art
                    laboratories and more than 70 classrooms. The university is committed to research and global
                    partnerships. This is why students are encouraged to engage in research projects, alongside
                    conventional classroom-based learning. The Independent University has academic research
                    collaborations with a number of prestigious universities including Harvard University, Stanford
                    University and the University of Colorado at Boulder.

                    IUB is the only university in Bangladesh that was shortlisted in the Times Higher Education (THE)
                    Awards 2020 for student recruitment campaign of the year. IUB's position is at the top in the whole
                    of Asia. According to world university rankings of Times Higher Education (THE) IUB stands within
                    400th universities globally in terms of various aspects of impact analysis.[[3]] The Ranking Web of
                    Universities (RWU) credited IUB as the top institution in the country in 2019. IUB, ranked 1st in
                    Bangladesh, was also ranked 859th among the 11,852 Asian universities (excluding the Middle East),
                    124th among the 4,479 universities in South Asia, and 3,006th among the 28,000+ universities in the
                    world. For comparison, the lowest ranking institution in Bangladesh (i.e., 147th), was ranked
                    10,701st in Asia, 4,155th in South Asia, and 26,428th in the world, which clearly shows a wide
                    spectrum of the quality of higher education in the country.

                    As the leading host institution for Fulbright Scholars in Bangladesh, the university offers exchange
                    programmes with scholars from top American and Canadian universities. The academic curriculum at the
                    Independent University is based on a North American liberal arts model, and courses are taught in
                    English. There are five academic schools at the university: School of Business and Entrepreneurship
                    (SBE); School of Engineering, Technology and Science (SETS); School of Environment and Life Sciences

                    There are a lot of opportunities outside of the classroom for students to get involved in. The
                    Division of Student Affairs is responsible for organising all student activities including the 17
                    university clubs. These include art club, debating club, economic club and film club. Students also
                    participate in community service programmes such as blood donation, fundraising for victims of
                    natural disasters and donating warm clothes in winter.
